# Simplified-torrent-like-file-sharing
A Python-based peer-to-peer file sharing simulation using TCP and UDP. Includes a tracker for peer discovery, file matching, and transfer functionality. Mimics torrent-like behavior in a simplified educational setup.

# To run a test 
Start the UDP Server first to allow connections from other components.
Launch the TCP Server to handle client requests.
Run the TCP Client, enter any desired name, and request the file "Tester.pdf" for testing.
